# Historical Stock/Revenue Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to extract and visualize historical stock and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop. Using Python, the project fetches data from the `yfinance` library and scrapes revenue data from a website. The collected data is then used to create a combined graph for each company, showing both historical share price and historical revenue. This visualization serves as a basic dashboard for analyzing key financial trends.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment used for the analysis and visualization.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib**: For plotting and data visualization.
* **yfinance**: A library to fetch stock market data from Yahoo Finance.
* **requests** and **BeautifulSoup**: Used for web scraping revenue data.
* **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.

## Files
* `stock_data_analysis_dashboard.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Key Insights
* The notebook provides a practical example of fetching real-world financial data using APIs and web scraping.
* It highlights how to combine different data sources to create a unified visualization.
* The generated plots allow for a direct visual comparison of a company's stock price and its reported revenue over time.
